# Cloud4all Pilot 3 Test Outcomes from the Rule-Based Matchmaker

In order to allow other researchers and developers to reproduce the matchmaker evaluation in Cloud4all's third evaluation phase, 
this repository contains the outcomes of the tests with the Rule-Based Matchmaker (RBMM). 

The subdirectory `common` contains the RBMM output expressed as common terms.

The subdirectory `appspec` contains the RBMM output expressed as application-specific terms.

In each subdirectory, the file `MMTest1aOUT.json` represents the matchmaker's inference for the payload `MMTest1a.json` 
([in the directory `testdata`](https://github.com/REMEXLabs/GPII-Matchmaker-Evaluation/tree/master/testdata)) etc. 
However, the files in the subdirectory `common` represent an intermediate step 
in the creation of the files in the subdirectory `appspec`.
